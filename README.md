# Overview

At first i thought i was going to do seperate files for each topic, but i have since chosen to do all presentations in one file.
This file is presentation.rmd.

The files in the .\misc folder was created to quickly make a .rmd file for each topic with the same yaml header.
This is no longer needed as all presentations are in presentation.rmd.
